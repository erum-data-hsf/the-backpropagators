# The Backpropagators
This repository contains educational resources and code examples related to Activation Functions in Neural Networks. The materials are designed to help learners understand the mathematical foundations and practical implementations of various activation functions used in deep learning.
The main content is organized in the form of a Jupyter Book, which includes detailed explanations, visualizations, and code snippets.
You can see the deployed version of the book [here](https://erum-data-hsf.github.io/the-backpropagators/practical_implementations.html).
